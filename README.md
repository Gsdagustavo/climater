- Light and dark theme modes, persisted across sessions
- Smooth **temperature animation** with `Tween`
- Uses `provider` for state management
- Secures your API key with `.env` and `flutter_dotenv`

## API Key Setup

1. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project:

   ```env
   API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

2. Load the `.env` in `main.dart`:

   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter_dotenv/flutter_dotenv.dart';

   void main() async {
     await dotenv.load();
     runApp(const MyApp());
   }
   ```

3. Access the key like this:

   ```dart
   final apiKey = dotenv.env['API_KEY'];
   ```

4. Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` to avoid committing secrets:

   ```gitignore
   .env
   ```
